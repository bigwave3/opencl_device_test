OpenCL Device Tester
by Matthew Scarpino

This project contains Android code for an app that checks for OpenCL-compliant devices. If it finds one, it calls clGetDeviceInfo to access the device's processing characteristics.

More precisely, the app requires that the libGLES_mali.so library be present in the Android's /system/vendor/lib/egl directory. If this library isn't there, the application won't run.

The code depends on the Android Native Development Kit (NDK) to compile. This build process requires that an OpenCL library be placed in the project's 'external' folder.
